project_description: |
  When Transaction Advisors acquired two related websites, Savas Labs helped integrate those sites into their existing Drupal 7 infrastructure, providing responsive theming, subscription access, and a single administrative interface for all three sites.
project_highlights: [Responsive web design, Drupal custom module development, Drupal multisite, Payment processing, Content migration]
project_objective: |
  After Transaction Advisors acquired two related publications (SatelliteFinance and TelecomFinance), they needed to easily manage all three websites from a single administrative interface. For branding purposes, they wanted a similar look and feel across the three sites. Lastly, it was critical to offer users online subscription access to each siteâ€™s paywall-protected content.
project_process: |
  We integrated the two new sites with the existing Transaction Advisors Drupal 7 installation and database using the Drupal Domain Access module, allowing each site to have its own domain name and theme while providing a single administrative interface. We extended the Transaction Advisors theme to the SatelliteFinance and TelecomFinance sites in a responsive way so that they worked on all devices. For easy subscription management and access to paywall restricted content we integrated [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) via a custom module. The Drupal Feeds module allowed us to import all content from the two legacy sites before going live.
project_results: |
  Thanks to an agile approach in which we worked closely with our client, the new sites launched in time for an important conference, the administrative burden from running three separate websites was reduced, and both the customers and the business felt the benefit of easy to manage subscriptions.

client_description: |
  Duke Today is a hub for news produced around Duke University. Articles are produced by staff and faculty across the university and health system to comprise a one-stop-shop for news from around Duke.
client_dates: 2016 - present
project_highlights: [Content migration, Custom module development, User experience enhancement, Dockerized deployment]
project_description: |
  After multiple organizational transitions left Duke's flagship news outlet's redesign incomplete and in need of a new development team nearly two years into the project, design and user experience agency Cuberis entrusted Savas Labs to audit the work, implement new functionality, and execute a complex content migration within a four-month turnaround.
project_objective: |
 Given the prolonged project history that had gone through two development agencies, when design agency and fellow Durham natives Cuberis asked Savas Labs to partner, our edict was to determine what was complete and what remained so we could deliver the finished product to an eager client as soon as possible.
project_process: |
  We began the engagement with a standard audit assessing system quality and functional completion. Once we were better oriented with organizational goals and remaining work, we used an automated testing framework to ensure protection of crucial business goals during the fast-paced development that was required. We collaborated daily with the Cuberis team to tie the established user experience with our functional improvements. We implemented system monitoring and staged work on Duke's cutting-edge custom hosting infrastructure using Docker containerization to enlist consistent feedback from all stakeholders throughout.
project_results: |
 With a focus on swift execution, we delivered the quality the Duke brand demands efficiently while surfacing valuable investments in best practices for security, monitoring and performance. The results were celebrated across the University. In four months, we took sixteen years and 120,000 articles worth of rich inter-departmental content and, through Cuberis's thoughtful design, made it more engaging and accessible for the broad and distributed Duke community.

## The long version

### Talk about importance of project/executing on time

### Migration

- Detail everything we migrated: so many nodes with refactored content types with tons of fields, very complex tags that were also refactored, tons of files
- Use numbers - maybe include a table?
 - 23593 files
 - 100421 nodes (13 content types)
 - 115 taxonomy terms
- Mention that it was important to migrate basically 100% of content, all the way back to year 2000

Possibly also discuss how a more strategic migration strategy makes sense in other cases in which you only port over, for example, the top 10% but they needed/wanted it all so it was worth substantial investment

### Feeds?

### Docker - development and deployment

project_description: |
  Over 5+ years, the Pauli Murray Project assembled a detailed map about Durham's Civil and Human Rights history. But their data was locked in a proprietary Google Map, which broke after an API update. Savas Labs worked with the Pauli Murray Project to create a fresh responsive design to showcase the rich detail of these important stories.
project_highlights: [Responsive web design, Drupal 8, Leaflet integration, Drupal contributed module development]
project_objective: |
  Savas Labs needed to move content out of the old Google MyMap (shown), and provide a map which was easy to navigate but also held detailed content for each point, spanning text write-ups, photos, and audio documentary pieces. We also wanted to create a structure that would make it easy for future Duke students working with the Center to add content to the map.
project_process: |
  Savas Labs worked with Barbara Lau of the Pauli Murray Project to develop wireframes for the new site, and built out a custom Drupal 8 theme incorporating maps both on the front page and on individual site pages. We hosted code sprints to get the [Views GeoJSON](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_geojson) module ported to Drupal 8, and even worked on updating Durham's neighborhood descriptions in OpenStreetMap so that the names of historically African-American neighborhoods would show up on the [CartoDB basemap](https://cartodb.com/location-data-services/basemaps/) for the new site and elsewhere.
project_results: |
  The Durham Civil and Human Rights History Map now has a beautifully-designed, and responsive, online home, which visitors and native Durhamites alike can use to tour the city. Savas Labs has also written a [number](/2015/06/10/d8-theming-basics.html) [of](/2015/07/06/map-in-drupal-8.html) [highly-viewed](/2015/05/18/mapping-geojson.html) [blog](/2015/09/03/sassy-drupal-theming-part-3.html) [posts](/2015/11/05/drupal-web-mapping.html) documenting what we've learned about Drupal 8 theming and mapping from the project.
